# Individual Project

This is individual project as part of MSIS 2626: Dashboard, Scorecard, and Visualization class. The topic of interest is **City of Chicagoâ€™s Automated Speed Enforcement Program** and [this](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4) is the data set to be used for the same.

There are 3 phases of this project:
* Data Exploration: The objective is to develop five distinct visualizations using Tableau that provide an effective overview of the data.
* First Version: The objective of this phase is to create a set of visualizations in an interesting, non-trivial, and somewhat unexpected
fashion intended for the Mayor of Chicago.
* Final Version: The objective of this phase is to further improvise our first version.
