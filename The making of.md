# Individual Project

This is individual project as part of MSIS 2626: Dashboard, Scorecard, and Visualization class. The topic of interest is **City of Chicago’s Automated Speed Enforcement Program** and [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4) is the data set used for this project.

There are 3 phases of this project:
* Data Exploration: The objective is to develop five distinct visualizations using Tableau that provide an effective overview of the data.
* First Version: The objective of this phase is to create a set of visualizations in an interesting, non-trivial, and somewhat unexpected
fashion intended for the Mayor of Chicago.
* Final Version: The objective of this phase is to further improvise our first version.

## Data Exploration:

### Background:
As per [this](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/children_s_safetyzoneporgramautomaticspeedenforcement.html) article: Chicago experiences roughly 3,000 crashes annually between motor vehicles and pedestrians, about 800 of which involve children. The Children’s Safety Zone Program protects children and other pedestrians by reminding motorists to slow down and obey speed laws – especially in school and park zones. Safety zones are designated as a 1/8th of a mile boundary around any Chicago parks or schools.
